A small but growing collection of text transformations that I use while refactoring!

![A sample of the extension editing two instances using the command palette.](https://graypegg.com/text-transform-sample.gif)

## Usage

There are currently 4 commands you can use.

1. `Transform to UPPERCASE`
    - Run of the mill uppercase.
2. `Transform to lowercase`
    - Run of the mill lowercase.
3. `Transform to camelCase`
    - Normally used for method names and keys.
4. `Transform to SNAKE_CASE`
    - Normally used for constants and translation keys.
  
Just select the text that needs to be transformed and run the command in the command palette. Alternatively you can find a list of them under Extensions > Text Transforms.

## Note

The extension can convert between case styles! If you select a camel case symbol, and transform to it to snake case, the delimiters will be converted! See the gif at the top of this file for an example.
